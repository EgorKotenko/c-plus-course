These people are running off at the mouth 
Tryin to convince me that i'm running on empty 
Tryin to convince themselves that the record with jay was a fluke 
That the record that i'm makin is a mistake 
And i cant take this 
Lemme tell you where i'm at with this 
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit 
I'm not plastic and fake 
When i make tracks i take facts and lay them out for the masses 
You assholes are gonna see soon that i'm not playin 
Start askin me the names that i'm not sayin 
But i'm tryin to be bigger than the bickerin 
Bigger than the petty name callin 
Under the breath talkin 
Rumors and labels and categorization 
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients 
But you can say what you want about me 
Keep talkin while i'm walkin away, bitch

You can say what you have to say 
Cuz my mind's made up anyway 
I'm taking the high road going above you 
This is the last time that i'm gonna trust you 
You can say what you have to say 
Cuz my mind's made up anyway 
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot 
But it's not gonna work today
