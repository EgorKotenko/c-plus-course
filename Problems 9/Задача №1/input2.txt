It's been twenty-two long hard years of still strugglin
Survival got me buggin, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not... could not...
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin -- going up state's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff

But you can say what you want about me 
Keep talkin while i'm walkin away, bitch
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin chase, sellin base
Smokin bones in the staircase

You can say what you have to say 
Cuz my mind's made up anyway 
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
I'm taking the high road going above you 
This is the last time that i'm gonna trust you 
You can say what you have to say 
Cuz my mind's made up anyway 
AEAEAEAEAEAE
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot 
But it's not gonna work today
